    <h3>To prepare the rice:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the rice in a large bowl and cover with very hot water; let it soak anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and drain again.</li><br>
        <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring softly for 2 to 3 minutes. Incorporate the onion and stir, from time to time, until the rice begins to change to a milky-white color and feels and sounds heavier, as if it were grains of sand; about 3 to 4 more minutes.Pour in the chicken stock, along with the celery, parsley, lime juice, salt and whole chile.</li><br>
        <li>When it comes to a rolling boil, cover the pot, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cook until the rice is cooked through and the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. If the rice grains don’t seem soft and cooked through, add a bit more chicken broth or water and let it cook for another 5 more minutes or so.</li><br>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork when ready to serve. Place the cooked plantains (below) on top. Place sour cream on the side for people to add to their rice and plantains if they like.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>To prepare the plantains:</h3>
    <h4>Note: The skin of the plantain should be almost entirely black when it is mature and ready to use in this recipe.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Peel the plantains and slice them diagonally into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li><br>
        <li>In a sauté pan, over medium heat, add about 1/4-inch of oil. Heat the oil until hot but not smoking. Add the plantain slices and fry until browned but not blackened, about 2 minutes per side, the oil should be bubbling around their edges of the plantain slices as they cook.</li><br>
        <li>Remove the plantains from the oil and drain them on a plate covered with paper towels.</li>
    </ul>
